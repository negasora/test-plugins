    "longdescription": "# Sidekick\n\nSidekick makes reversing easy. Sidekick is an extension to the BinaryNinja desktop application supported by an AI-powered service that provides new capabilities to help users analyze and understand binary programs.\n\nThe Sidekick plugin is currently available as an official plugin from the Binary Ninja plugin manager.  The plugin will not be fully functional without a Sidekick service plan. To purchase a Sidekick plan, you must have a Sidekick account. To sign up for a Sidekick account, click [here](https://sidekick.binary.ninja/sign_in).\n\n## Deep Analysis for Binaries\n\n### Let Sidekick Search for Answers\n\nWant to know more about the code? Use the Analysis Console to gain deeper insights as you drive discussions with its Assistant that explores and analyzes the binary for you.\n\n![analysis console](https://sidekick.binary.ninja/static/images/carousel-analysis-console.png?raw=true)\n\n### Create Points of Interest\n\nAnalysis Indexes organize points of interest from the binary by topic, which can be added by the Analysis Console Assistant and scripts. Indexes can store intermediate results, which are then used as inputs for further analysis.\n\n![analysis indexes](https://sidekick.binary.ninja/static/images/carousel-analysis-indexes.png?raw=true)\n\n### Visualize Relationships\n\nTired of looking at busy, cluttered graphs to understand what the code is doing? Sidekick comes with the Code Insight Map view to help you quickly obtain a top-level understanding of the structure and functionality in the binary. Use this graph-based interface to selectively explore the content of and relationships among a focused set of topics.\n\n![code insight map](https://sidekick.binary.ninja/static/images/carousel-code-insight-map.png?raw=true)\n\n## Smart Automation\n\n### Apply Large Language Models to Program Analysis\n\nSeamlessly leverage the advanced capabilities of Large Language Models for program analysis using the Automation Workbench. For these models, select from a catalog of available models or even bring your own model.\n\n![automation workbench llm operators](https://sidekick.binary.ninja/static/images/carousel-automation-workbench-scripts.png?raw=true)\n\n### Let Sidekick Write the Scripts and Prompts\n\nNot a Binary Ninja API expert or prompt engineer? Work together with the Scripting Assistant to write your scripts and LLM prompts, saving you valuable development time.\n\n![automation workbench scripting assistant](https://sidekick.binary.ninja/static/images/carousel-automation-workbench-scripting-assistant.png?raw=true)\n\n## Improved Decompilation\n\n### Recover Structures\n\nWhen the code contains a lot of references to structures and fields, things can get rather cluttered with all of the dereferenced pointers, field offsets, and nesting going on. Let Sidekick clean up and simplify all that by automatically identifying and creating referenced structures through its sophisticated program analyses.\n\n![structure recovery before](https://sidekick.binary.ninja/static/images/carousel-structure-recovery.png?raw=true)\n\n### Name Your Functions and Variables\n\nGood names convey meaning and help you immediately understand what something is. Without them, it takes valuable time to understand the code. Let Sidekick analyze your code and give you meaningful names for functions, structures, fields, and variables.\n\n![naming](https://sidekick.binary.ninja/static/images/carousel-improved-decompilation.png?raw=true)\n\n### Summarize Code\n\nSometimes the code you're looking at can be quite large and complex. Sidekick can help cut down on the time you spend figuring out the bigger picture by automatically summarizing entire functions with an informative comment. Also, when you're focusing on the finer details, Sidekick has you covered. It can quickly produce clear, descriptive inline comments that explain any logic you encounter.\n\n![comments](https://sidekick.binary.ninja/static/images/carousel-decompilation-comments.png?raw=true)\n# Release Notes\n\nSidekick Client Revision: 3.1.240\n\n## Update Instructions\n\nIf you are updating from a current installation of the Sidekick plugin, then complete the following instructions based on the version of Binary Ninja currently installed:\n\nBinary Ninja version 4.2.5814 or later:\n\n* Open the Plugin Manager\n* Locate the Sidekick plugin\n* Click `Update`\n\nBinary Ninja version before 4.2.5814:\n\n* Open the Plugin Manager\n* Locate the Sidekick plugin\n* Click `Uninstall`\n* Restart Binary Ninja\n* Open the Plugin Manager\n* Locate the Sidekick plugin\n* Click `Install`\n\n## Release Changes\n\n### Analysis\n\n* Fix: Fix OverflowError on entries in Analysis Indexes\n\n### UI\n\n* Fix: Fix link to the Sidekick User Guide documentation page from the Sidekick Plugin main menu\n",

Note that the [community-plugins repo](https://github.com/Vector35/community-plugins) contains a useful [utility](https://github.com/Vector35/community-plugins/blob/master/generate_plugininfo.py) to validate the plugin.json. Additionally, the [release helper](https://github.com/Vector35/release_helper) plugin is helpful for more easily pushing new releases, incrementing versions, and creating the appropriate GitHub tags.\n\nNote that originally we recommended specifying the contents of this entire file inside of the [plugin.json](./plugin.json) but the latest repository generator will use the readme contents directly which means you should simply leave an empty longdescription field. \n\n## Minimum Version\n\nThis plugin requires the following minimum version of Binary Ninja:\n\n * 3000\n\n## License\n\nThis plugin is released under an [MIT license](./license).\n\n## Metadata Version\n\n2\n",
