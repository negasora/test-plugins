    "longdescription": "# Sidekick\n\nSidekick makes reversing easy. Sidekick is an extension to the BinaryNinja desktop application supported by an AI-powered service that provides new capabilities to help users analyze and understand binary programs.\n\nThe Sidekick plugin is currently available as an official plugin from the Binary Ninja plugin manager.  The plugin will not be fully functional without a Sidekick service plan. To purchase a Sidekick plan, you must have a Sidekick account. To sign up for a Sidekick account, click <a href='https://sidekick.binary.ninja/sign_in'>here</a>.\n\n# Features\n\n## Recover Structures\n\nWhen the code contains a lot of references to structures and fields, things can get rather cluttered with all of the dereferenced pointers, field offsets, and nesting going on. Let Sidekick clean up and simplify all that by automatically identifying and creating referenced structures through its sophisticated program analyses.\n\nBefore Structure Recovery\n\n![structure recovery before](https://sidekick.binary.ninja/static/images/features-structure-recovery-before.png?raw=true)\n\nAfter Structure Recovery\n\n![structure recovery after](https://sidekick.binary.ninja/static/images/features-structure-recovery-after.png?raw=true)\n\n## Generate Meaningful Names\n\nGood names convey meaning and help you immediately understand what something is. Without them, it takes valuable time to understand the code. Thankfully, Sidekick analyzes your code and automatically generates meaningful names for functions, structures, fields, and variables.\n\n![naming](https://sidekick.binary.ninja/static/images/features-naming.png?raw=true)\n\n## Summarize Code\n\nSometimes, the code you're looking at can be quite large and complex. Sidekick can help cut down on the time you spend figuring out the bigger picture by automatically summarizing entire functions with an informative comment. Also, when you're focusing on the finer details, Sidekick has you covered. It can quickly produce clear, descriptive inline comments that explain any logic you encounter.\n\n![comments](https://sidekick.binary.ninja/static/images/features-comments.png?raw=true)\n\n## Answer Your Questions\n\nDon't know something about the code? Delve deeper into analysis of the binary as you drive discussions with the Sidekick AI assistant that possesses a vast amount of knowledge and code reasoning capabilities useful for reversing.\n\n![assistant](https://sidekick.binary.ninja/static/images/features-assistant.png?raw=true)\n\n## Launch Investigations\n\nSoftware is complex and can take significant resources to analyze. Sidekick is equipped and ready for you to launch focused investigations of the binary, where Sidekick guides the analysis, looking for evidences of the topic you want to research.\n\n![investigations](https://sidekick.binary.ninja/static/images/features-investigations.png?raw=true)\n\n## Search Effectively\n\nLooking for something in the binary and not sure where to find it? Sidekick comes with a catalog of powerful scripts that find items you care about. Need something more? Just describe what you want and let Sidekick generate the script for you automatically.\n\n![indexes](https://sidekick.binary.ninja/static/images/features-indexes.png?raw=true)\n\n## Visualize Behaviors\n\nTired of looking at busy, cluttered graphs to understand what the code is doing? Sidekick comes with the Code Insight Map view to help you quickly obtain a top-level understanding of the structure and functionality in the binary. Use this graph-based interface to selectively explore the content of and relationships among a focused set of topics.\n\n![code insight map](https://sidekick.binary.ninja/static/images/features-code-insight-map.png?raw=true)\n# Release Notes\n\nSidekick Client Revision: 1.0.116\n\n## Release Changes\n\n- Improvement: Update major version number to 1.0!\n- Improvement: Update backend to improve support for inline commenting\n",

    "longdescription": "# Sample Plugin\nAuthor: **Vector 35 Inc**\n\n_This is a short description meant to fit on one line._\n\n## Description:\nThis is a longer description meant for a sample plugin that demonstrates the metadata format for Binary Ninja plugins. Note that the [community-plugins repo](https://github.com/Vector35/community-plugins) contains a useful [utility](https://github.com/Vector35/community-plugins/blob/master/generate_plugininfo.py) to validate the plugin.json. Additionally, the [release helper](https://github.com/Vector35/release_helper) plugin is helpful for more easily pushing new releases, incrementing versions, and creating the appropriate GitHub tags.\n\nNote that originally we recommended specifying the contents of this entire file inside of the [plugin.json](./plugin.json) but the latest repository generator will use the readme contents directly which means you should simply leave an empty longdescription field. \n\n## Minimum Version\n\nThis plugin requires the following minimum version of Binary Ninja:\n\n * 3000\n\n## License\n\nThis plugin is released under an [MIT license](./license).\n\n## Metadata Version\n\n2\n",
